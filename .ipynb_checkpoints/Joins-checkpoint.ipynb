    "# Joins, Unions.  \n",
    "## 2.1 Joins\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Join Concepts\n",
    "* Combine rows from multiple tables by specifying matching creiteria\n",
    " * Usually based on primary key - foreign key relationships\n",
    " * For example return rows that combine data from the Employee and SalesOrder tables by matching the EmployeeID primary key to the SalesOrder.EmployeeID foreign key.\n",
    " \n",
    " It would help to think of joins as venn diagrams.\n",
    " \n",
    "###  Join Syntax\n",
    " * ANSI SQL-92\n",
    "  * Tables joined by JOIN operator in FROM Clause\n",
    "   * Preferred syntax \n",
    "   * SELECT ... FROM Table1 JOIN Table2 ON <on_predicate>;\n",
    " * ANSI SQL-89\n",
    "  * Table joined by commas in FROM Clasue\n",
    "   * Not recommended: Accidental Cartesian products!\n",
    "   * SELECT ... FROM Table1, Table2 Where <where_predicate>;\n",
    " Cartesian products are every single combinatations. We would use the ANSI SQL-92 in most cases but an example of the SQL-89 if is we have a table of employees and a table of open positions. We can join both tables then filter for employee-job combinations where the employee meets the job requirement.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Different Type of Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inner Joins\n",
    "* Return only rows where a match is found in both input tables\n",
    "* Match rows based on the attributes supplied in predicate \n",
    "* If join predicate operator is =, also known as equi-join.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/join.PNG)\n",
    "Below we have an example, by default sql server and azure JOIN means INNER JOIN.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "* Inner joins return only rows where a match can be found in both tables.\n",
    "* Inner joins that match rows based on columns containing the same value in both tables are sometimes referred to as equi-joins.\n",
    "### Outer Joins \n",
    "* Return all rows from one table and any matching rows from second table.\n",
    "* One table's are \"preserved\"\n",
    " * Designated with LEFT, RIGHT, FULL Keyword\n",
    " * All rows from preserved table output to result set\n",
    "* Matches from other table retrieved\n",
    "* Additional rows added to results from non-matched rows\n",
    " * NULLs added in places where attricutes do not match. \n",
    "![](img/join2.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points \n",
    "* Use a Left Outer Join to include all rows from the first table and values from matched rows in the second table. Columns in the second table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs.\n",
    "* Use a Right Outer Join to include all rows from the second table and values from matched rows in the first table. Columns in the first table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs.\n",
    "* Use a Full Outer Join to include all rows from the first and second tables. Columns in the either table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross Joins\n",
    "* Combine each row from the first table with each row from second table.\n",
    "* All possible combinations output \n",
    "![](img/join3.PNG)\n",
    "Above we are using SQL-92 syntax which is better than SQL-89 as we are explicit in the key word <code>CROSS</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "* A cross join returns a Cartesian product that includes every combination of the selected columns from both tables.\n",
    "* While not commonly used in typical application processing, cross joins can be useful in some specialized scenarios - such as generating test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self Join\n",
    "* Compare rows in same table to each other\n",
    "* Create two instances of same table in FROM clause\n",
    " * At least one alias required\n",
    "* Example: Return all Employees and the name of the employee's manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/join4.PNG)\n",
    "### KEY POINTS\n",
    "* A self-join is an inner, outer, or cross join that matches rows in a table to other rows in the same table. \n",
    "* When defining a self-join, you must specify an alias for at least one instance of the table being joined."

    "# Union Queries\n",
    "### What are UNION Queries?\n",
    "* UNION returns a result set of distinct rows combined from all statements\n",
    "* UNION removes duplicates during query processing (affects performance)\n",
    "* UNION ALL retains duplicates during query processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes If you know there are no duplicates using UNION ALL will be quicker then using UNION which will check for duplicates. \n",
    "![](img/union.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### UNION Guidelines\n",
    "* Column aliases\n",
    " * Must be expressed in first query\n",
    "* Number of columns\n",
    " * must be the same\n",
    "* Data types\n",
    " * Must be compartible for implicit conversion(or converted explicitly)\n",
    " \n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "* Use UNION to combine the rowsets returned by mulitple queries.\n",
    "* Each unioned query must return the same number of columns with compatible data types.\n",
    "* By default, UNION eliminates duplicate rows. Specify the ALL option to include duplicates (or to avoid the overhead of checking for duplicates when you know in advance that there are none). \n",
    "\n",
    "### INTERSECT and EXCEPT Queries\n",
    "* INTERSECT return only distinct rows that appear in both result sets\n",
    "![](img/intersect.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "* EXCEPT returns only distinct rows that appear in the first set but not the second\n",
    " * Order in which set \n",
