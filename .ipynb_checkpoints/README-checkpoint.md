# Introduction to Transact SQL
The goal of these notebooks are to assist others in learning and mastering data science. From these notebooks one should learn the in and outs of querying relational data. If you are completing the [Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science](https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/tracks/data-science/) these notebooks may act as a guide in the case that you are struggling with a concept. The notebook are based on the 
[Microsoft - DAT201x](https://www.edx.org/course/querying-data-with-transact-sql-2) found on the [edx](https://www.edx.org/) platform. Let's get started!

# Notebooks Installation
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks to follow along with the lectures. However, there are several packages and applications that need to be installed. It is recommended to install anaconda at (https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Alternatively you may just want to go with just a python 3 install and use pip to install numpy, matplotlib, pandas alongwith jupyterlab or jupyter notebook.

## Install Git
Follow the instructions at (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

# Getting Started
The VM(Virtual Machine) is a Linux server system that runs on top of your own computer. You can share files easily between your computer and the VM; and you'll be running a web service inside the VM which you'll be able to access from your regular browser. Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem. If you are following along, part 3 and after will require installation of virtualBox and vagrant. 

## Run Notebooks
1. Clone the repository to a desired location (E.g. `git clone https://github.com/stang84/t-sql`)
2. Open up jupyter labs or jupyter notebook either though anaconda navigator or terminal. 
3. Go to the repository directory
